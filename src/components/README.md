## Setup Giscus

1. The repository is public, otherwise visitors will not be able to view the discussion.
2. The [giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus) app is installed, otherwise visitors will not be able to comment and react.
3. The Discussions feature is turned on by [enabling it for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository).
4. Change data-repo, repo-id, category-id. View in here [how to get repo id github](https://github.com/laymonage/base/discussions/14#discussioncomment-1921998).
